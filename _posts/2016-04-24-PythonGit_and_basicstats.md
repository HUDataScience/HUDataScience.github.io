The python codes written during the class  by Mickael are online in the class' [github]({{site.giturl}}/StatisticalMethods2016) notebooks (see Lesson2_...).

## Exercices:

Last week exercice (sheet-1) has not been corrected in this "python intro" special lecture.

The new exercise sheet (updated, not quite the same as the one provided in class, sorry, wrong version printed) is available [online]({{site.googledriveurl}}) ([direct pdf here]({{site.googledriveurl}}/exercises/exercise_sheet2.pdf)). 

Data for the exercise are [on github]({{site.giturl}}/StatisticalMethods2016) (notebooks/data)

Feel free to do the exercises in group.
